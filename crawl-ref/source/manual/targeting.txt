I. Targeting
****************************************

When throwing or firing something, evoking wands, or casting certain spells,
you are asked for a direction. There are several ways to tell Crawl which
monster to target.

You can press '?' when asked for a direction; this will bring up a help screen.
Otherwise, you use the following commands:

- The cursor will target on the monster which is closest to your position.
  Should you have been firing at something previously, with the offender still
  being in sight, the cursor will instead rest on the previous target.
- Pressing '+' or '=' moves the cursor to the next monster, going from nearer to
  further away. Similarly, '-' cycles backwards.
- Any direction key moves the cursor by one square. Occasionally, it can be
  useful to target non-inhabited squares.
- Targets can be selected from a list by pressing 'Ctrl-X'.
- When you are content with your choice of target, press one key of Enter, Del,
  or Space to fire at the target. If you press '.', you also fire, but the
  spell/missile will stop at the target's square if it misses. This can be
  useful to keep friendlies out of the fire, or to make sure your precious
  missiles won't end up in deep water.
- You can press Escape if you changed your mind - no turns are deducted.

There are some shortcuts while targeting:

- Typing Shift-direction on your keypad fires straight away in that direction.
- Pressing 'p' or 'f' fires at the previous target (if it is still alive and in
  sight). Due to this, most hunters can go a long way by pressing 'vf' to fire
  their ammunition at a monster and then keep firing at it with further 'vf'
  strokes. At times, it will be useful to switch targets with the '+' or '-'
  commands, though.

If you target yourself while firing something harmful (which can be sensible at
times), you will be asked for confirmation.

Finally, the ':' key allows you to hide the path of your spell/wand/missile.
