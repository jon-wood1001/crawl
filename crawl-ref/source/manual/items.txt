G. Items
****************************************

In the dungeons of Crawl there are many different kinds of normal and magical
items to be found and used. Some of them are useful, some are nasty, and
some give great power, but at a price. Some items are unique; these have
interesting properties which can make your life rather bizarre for a while. They
all fall into several classes of items, each of which is used in a different
way. Here is a general list of what you might find in the course of your
adventures, how they are displayed, and what commands there are to use them:

=======  =============  ================================================
)        weapons        (use 'w'ield)
(        missiles       (use 'f'ire or 'F'ire, 'Q' to quiver)
[        armour         (use 'W'ear and 'T'ake off)
?        scrolls        (use 'r'ead)
!        potions        (use 'q'uaff)
/        wands          (use 'V' to evoke, 'Q' to quiver)
=        rings          (use 'P'ut on and 'R'emove)
"        amulets        (use 'P'ut on and 'R'emove)
\|       staves         (use 'w'ield)
:        spellbooks     (use 'M'emorise and 'z'ap, 'Q' to quiver)
%        talismans      (use 'V' to evoke)
}        miscellaneous  (use 'V' to evoke, 'Q' to quiver)
$        gold           (use 'g' to pick up)
=======  =============  ================================================

There are several general keys for item management:

d
  drop item; if you want to drop only some items from a stack (of arrows, for
  example), then press 'd' followed by a number and then the item's slot key

g
  pick up item from the ground (also with the comma key ',')

=
  reassign item slot (works also for spell slots and abilities)

i
  show inventory - pressing the key of an item shows additional information

{
  inscribe item (see Appendix `5. Inscriptions`_)

\\
  check list of already discovered items

Item usage
========================================

You pick up items with the 'g'et or ',' (comma) command, and drop them with the
'd'rop command. When you are given a prompt like "drop which item?", if you type
a number before the letter of the item, you will drop that quantity of the item
(similarly when picking up). The same works if you want to pick up only part of
a stack and there are several types of items on the square (so that they are
shown in a list). When there is only a single stack of arrows and you want to
pick up only some of them, use the ';' command. Note that picking up items from
one square takes exactly one turn. However, dropping several items at once takes
more turns.

Typing 'i' displays your inventory (what you are carrying). When you are given a
prompt like "Throw [or Wield, Wear, etc] which item?", you usually get a list of
all available options. You can press '*' in case you want to wield something
unusual. When the inventory screen shows "-more-", to show you that there is
another page of items, you can type the letter of the item you want, even if it
is not visible, instead of pressing Space or Enter to see the next page.

You can carry at most 52 items at once, and your item slot usage is printed at
the top of the inventory screen.

You can use the adjust command (the '=' key) to change the letters to which your
possessions are assigned. This command can be used to change spell or ability
letters, too.

Items like scrolls, potions, and some other types each have a characteristic,
like a label or a colour, which will let you tell them apart on the basis of
their function. However, these characteristics change between each game, so
while in one game every potion of curing may be yellow, in another game they
might all be purple and bubbly. Once you have discovered the function of such an
item, you will remember it for the rest of the current game. You can access your
item discoveries with the '\\' key.

In order to get a description of what an item does, bring up the inventory (with
'i') and press the letter of that item. Try this when comparing different types
of armours and weapons, but don't expect too much information from examining
unidentified items.

In most equipment-related prompts and menus, the ';' key is a shortcut for
"last unequipped item," meaning the armour, jewellery or weapon you most
recently took off or unwielded.

Another useful command is the '{' key, which lets you inscribe items with a
comment. You can also inscribe items when looking at your inventory with 'i',
simply by pressing the letter of an item. For more details, and how to automate
this process, check Appendix `5. Inscriptions`_.

) Weapons
========================================

These are rather important. You will find a variety of weapons in the dungeon,
ranging from small and quick daggers to huge, cumbersome battleaxes and
polearms. Each type of weapon does a different amount of damage, has a different
chance of hitting its target, and takes a different amount of time to swing.
There are several weapon skills (press 'm' to show a list of those that you are
training) like Short Blades, Long Blades, Axes, etc. These skills affect damage,
accuracy, and speed (up to a point). The same goes for Unarmed Combat.

Weapons can be enchanted; when you first identify them, you reveal values which
tell you how much more effective they are than an unenchanted version. Weapons
which are not enchanted are simply '+0'. Some weapons also have special magical
effects which make them very effective against vulnerable enemies.

You can wield weapons with the 'w' command, which is a very quick action. If for
some reason you want to go bare-handed, type 'w' followed by a hyphen ('-').

The ' (apostrophe) key is a shortcut which automatically wields the item in slot
a. If item a is being wielded, ' causes you to wield item b instead, if
possible. Try assigning the letter a to your primary weapon, and b to your bow
or something else you need to wield only sometimes. Note that this is just a
typing shortcut and is not functionally different to wielding these items
normally.

( Missiles
========================================

If monsters are disobligingly distant, you can use missiles to weaken (or kill!)
them from afar. You'll find a variety of type, ranging from simple stones and
piercing javelins to sophisticated darts covered in many types of poisons. Upon
impact, missiles may become destroyed. The chance for this to occur depends on
the type of missile.

The 'F' and 'f' commands can be used to throw a missile. The default type to be
thrown (which 'f' will launch) is shown in the "quiver" display below your
weapon. Many other items, spells, and abilities can fill this quiver as well.

See Appendix `5. Inscriptions`_ for inscriptions which let you fine-tune the
list of items to choose from. See also the Missiles section of
options_guide.txt.

Use the '(', ')' to cycle through your quiver without firing, and 'Q' to choose
a quivered item from a list. If you would like to choose something to fire
without inserting it into the quiver, use 'F' instead.

The interface for shooting or throwing things is also used for evoking wands and
casting certain spells, and is described in detail in section I (Targeting).

[ Armour
========================================

This is also rather important. Most worn armour improves your Armour Class,
which decreases the amount of damage you take from most types of injury. The
heavier an armour is, the more AC (armour class) it will provide, at the expense
of your EV (evasion) and stealth. Wearing heavy armour also increases your
chances of miscasting spells and slow your attacks with missile weapons, effects
which are only slightly reduced by your Armour skill. These penalties are larger
if you have low Strength.

A shield normally increases neither your AC nor your evasion, but it lets you
attempt to block melee attacks and some ranged attacks aimed at you. Wearing a
shield (especially larger shields) slows your attacks, hampers your ability to
cast spells, and lowers your evasion. Weaker characters are more affected by
these penalties, but all characters can reduce and eventually eliminate these
penalties by mastering the Shields skill. You also obviously cannot wield a
two-handed weapon while wearing a shield. Shields are most effective against
the first attack on you each turn, and become less useful for every one after
that.

Some magical armours have special powers. These powers are sometimes automatic,
affecting you whenever you wear the armour, and sometimes must be activated with
the 'a' command.

You can wear armour with the 'W' command, and take it off with the 'T' command.
With '[' you can have a quick look at your current gear.

Most armours can be improved by reading the appropriate scroll. Body armour and
bardings can be enchanted up to the base value of AC they provide. Shields can
be enchanted up to +3, +5, or +8, depending on their size. Other gear is limited
to +2.

? Magical Scrolls
========================================

Scrolls have many different magical spells inscribed on them, some good and some
bad. One of the most useful scrolls is the scroll of identify, which will tell
you the function of any item you have in your inventory; you might want to save
these up for items that are dangerous or wasteful to use when unidentified, such
as potions or other scrolls. You can read scrolls (and by doing so invoke their
magic) with the 'r' command.

! Magical Potions
========================================

While scrolls tend to affect your equipment or your environment, most potions
affect your character in some way. The most common type is the simple curing
potion, which restores some health and cures many ailments, but there are
many other varieties of potions to be found. Potions can be quaffed (drunk) with
the 'q' command.

/ Wands
========================================

Sometimes you will be lucky enough to find a stick which contains stored magical
energies. Wands each have a certain number of charges, which you immediately
recognise when you pick them up. When you pick up a wand of type you already
have in inventory, its charges are absorbed into the existing one. When a wand's
charges are fully depleted, it vanishes.

Wands are aimed in the same way as missile weapons, and you can release the
power of a wand by evoking it with 'V'. See section I for targeting.

Wands can be 'Q'uivered in order to shoot via the autofire or 'f'ire
interface, like spells and ammo.

=" Rings and Amulets
========================================

Magical rings are among the most useful of the items you will find in the
dungeon. While equipped, they provide some kind of passive benefit to the
wearer, such as increasing their attributes or providing various types of
protection. Use the 'P' command to put on rings, and 'R' to remove them. You can
wear up to two rings simultaneously, one on each hand; which hand you put a ring
on is immaterial to its function. If you try to put on a ring while both ring
fingers are full, you will be asked which one to remove. Octopodes are an
exception, and may wear up to eight rings on their tentacles.

Amulets are similar to rings, but have different range of effects. Amulets are
worn around the neck, and you can wear only one at a time. It is very quick to
wear or remove a ring, but amulets' magics make them cumbersome to put on or
take off.

You can press '"' to quickly check what jewellery you're wearing.

\| Staves
========================================

There are a number of types of magical staves, each attuned to a different
class of spells. While wielded they greatly increase the power of that class
of spells. They can even be used in melee combat, although with mediocre
effectiveness unless you can harness their special power, using a combination of
the Evocations skill and the skill specific to the staff's type.

: Books
========================================

Most books contain magical spells which your character may be able to learn.
Upon picking up a book, all of the spells in it will be added to your spell
library, allowing you to access a description of each spell or memorise spells
from it with the 'M' command.

Occasionally you will find manuals of some skill. When you pick one up, your
experience will have twice the usual effect when used for training that skill.
Once a certain amount of bonus experience has been gained in this way, you will
automatically discard the finished manual.

% Talismans
========================================

Talismans allow their user to shift into a different form. Entering or leaving
a form with a talisman requires a brief period of concentration, but otherwise,
forms last until the user chooses to leave them.

More powerful talismans require some amount of Shapeshifting skill, without
which a user will find their maximum health reduced until they leave the form.
Shapeshifting skill also increases other benefits provided by talismans' forms,
though weaker talismans have a limit to how helpful skill can be.

{ Miscellaneous
========================================

These are items which don't fall into any other category. They can be evoked
with 'V', just like wands. Runes, a particular item in this category, have no
function whatsoever except to open the endgame. You must collect at least three
in order to enter the Realm of Zot. Some particularly cocky adventurers brag
about having retrieved ten or even fifteen runes through their strength and
cunning, but most scholars on the subject of Zot agree that such a thing is
probably impossible in the first place, and secondly would be a meaningless
achievement in any regard.

Miscellany can often be 'Q'uivered in order to shoot via the autofire or 'f'ire
interface, like spells and ammo.

$ Gold
========================================

Gold can be used to buy items should you run across shops. There are also a
few more esoteric uses for gold.

Artefacts
========================================

Weapons, armour, jewellery and spellbooks can be artefacts. These come in two
flavours: randomly created artefacts ('randarts') and predefined ones
('unrandarts'). Randarts will always carry unusual names, such as "golden
double sword" or "shimmering scale mail". Artefacts cannot be modified in any
way, including enchantments.

Apart from that, otherwise mundane items can get one special property. These are
called 'ego items', and examples are: boots of flight, a weapon of flaming, a
helmet of see invisible, and so on. Note that, unlike artefacts, such items can
be modified by enchanting scrolls.

All ego items are noted with special adjectives but not all items noted in this
way need have a special property (they often have some positive enchantment,
instead):

:general: glowing, runed;
:metal armours: shiny;
:leather armours: dyed;
:other armours: embroidered.
