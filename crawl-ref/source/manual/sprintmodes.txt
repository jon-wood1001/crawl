6. Dungeon sprint modes
****************************************

Dungeon sprints are short, faster-paced variants of Crawl that aim at more of a
"coffee break" style of gameplay. They can be accessed from the main menu, and
save files coexist with regular game saves. Sprint modes all use the basic
Crawl mechanics, but with certain aspects of the game sped up. All sprint
games take place on a single map. The most noticeable speed change is much more
rapid experience gain, as well as piety growth. Many sprint modes focus on some
specific aspect of the game, and several introduce variant mechanics or items
unique to that mode. In all of the sprint maps, you win by finding and escaping
with the Orb of Zot, but the conditions for finding the Orb vary.

Sprint I: "Red Sonja"
  Red Sonja, originally called "dungeon sprint 1", is the original dungeon
  sprint map, putting the quest for the Orb of Zot into a single level.

Sprint II: "The Violet Keep of Menkaure"
  Menkaure has stolen the Orb of Zot and hidden it away in his keep; can you
  find it?

Sprint III: "The Ten Rune Challenge"
  Originally introduced in the 2010 tournament, this sprint map places 10 runes
  and the Orb of Zot in a single dungeon level.

Sprint IV: "Fedhas' Mad Dash"
  Fedhas' Mad Dash is a shorter sprint map, a contest organised by Fedhas Madash.
  The monsters are Fedhas-themed; watch out for the many flavours of Oklobs! As
  usual, your goal is to find the Orb of Zot and then escape.

Sprint V: "Ziggurat Sprint"
  Ziggurat Sprint focuses on the Ziggurat mechanic. The map consists of a
  sequence of open-layout rooms of increasing size and difficulty, each with
  many monsters around some theme; rooms are connected by transporters. The
  starting room provides powerful equipment for getting started, as well as
  altars. If you can make it through all rooms, you will be taken to a room with
  the Orb and some exit stairs.

Sprint VI: "Thunderdome"
  In the Thunderdome you face a large set of monsters, including many uniques,
  in a cross-shaped arena. Monsters appear in rounds, with boss rounds every 5
  rounds (every 3 after round 27), and the final boss at round 27. If you kill
  every monster in a normal or boss round, you will get some gold, arena points,
  and a bit of time to rest. In a lightning round, to win you just need to
  survive. A variety of interesting items are available for purchase in shops
  along the sides -- don't miss the QUAD DAMAGE! To win this sprint, kill the
  final boss, and the Orb will appear.

Sprint VII: "The Pits"
  This map is a "traditional-style" sprint map that embeds the quest for the Orb
  of Zot into a dungeon level with three runes.

Sprint VIII: "Arena of Blood"
  In the Arena of Blood, also known as "meatsprint", you are a vessel of Makhleb,
  wielding Makhleb's immensely destructive Axe of Woe against a large variety of
  meat-based monsters in an open arena. To win this mode, kill the Meatlord,
  pick up the Orb of Zot, and escape.

Sprint IX: "|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||"
  This mode, also known as "linesprint", puts the entire game of Crawl in a
  single winding 1-space corridor, with each region as one straight line. Fight
  your way to the middle of the map to claim the Orb of Zot. Escape with it,
  or continue onwards to collect all runes first.
