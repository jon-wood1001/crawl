3. List of skills
****************************************

Here is a description of the skills you may have. You can check your current
skills with the 'm' command, and therein toggle between progress display and
aptitude display using '*'. You can also read the table of aptitudes from the
help menu using '?%', and during character choice with '%'.

Fighting skills
========================================

Fighting is the basic skill used in ranged and melee combat, and applies no
matter which weapon your character is wielding (if any). Fighting is also the
skill that determines the amount of health your character gains as they
increase in levels (note that this is calculated so that you don't get a long
run advantage by starting out with a high Fighting skill). Unlike the specific
weapon skill, Fighting does not change the speed with which you make your
attacks.

Weapon skills affect your ability to fight with specific melee weapons. Weapon
skills include:

  * Short Blades
  * Long Blades
  * Maces &amp; Flails
  * Axes
  * Staves
  * Polearms

If you are already good using a class of weapons, say Long Blades, you'll get
a bonus to using similar weapons, like Short Blades; this is called
crosstraining and is shown in blue in the skill menu. Similar types of weapons
are:

  * Short Blades and Long Blades
  * Maces &amp; Flails and Axes
  * Polearms and Axes
  * Staves and Polearms
  * Staves and Maces &amp; Flails

Being good at a specific weapon improves the speed with which you attack with it.
Both the base speed and the best (lowest) possible speed are displayed in the
inventory entry for a weapon. Although lighter weapons are easier to use
initially, as they strike quickly and accurately, heavier weapons increase in
damage potential very quickly as you improve your skill with them. You can check
the current delay of your weapon by swinging it at air (using ctrl-direction) and
looking at the number in parentheses next to your turncount.

Some weapon types have special abilities. Axes are able to cleave through
multiple enemies in a single swing, hitting enemies in an arc around the
wielder with every attack. Polearms can reach farther and allow the wielder to
attack an opponent two squares away, and even reach over monsters. Use the 'v'
command to target a specific monster with a reaching attack, or use Autofight
('tab') to reach automatically.

Unarmed Combat is a special fighting skill. It allows your character to make a
powerful attack when unarmed and also to punch with the off hand as an
additional melee attack. The Unarmed Combat skill continues to increase your
attack speed while unarmed until it can be raised no more.

Note that auxiliary attacks (such as a Armataur's tail-slap or a Minotaur's
headbutt) are not affected by the Unarmed Combat skill.

Ranged combat skills
========================================

Ranged Weapons is the skill for bows, crossbows, and slings, whereas Throwing
governs all things hurled without a launcher: boomerangs, javelins, nets,
darts, etc.

Just as with melee weapons, ranged weapon skills and throwing skills increase
the speed at which you attack, along with slightly increasing your accuracy
and damage. Missile weapons, unlike melee or throwing weapons, are slowed by
wearing heavy armour. Increasing your Strength and Armour skill will partially
mitigate this.

Magic skills
========================================

Spellcasting is the basic skill for magic use. It affects your reserves of
magical energy (Magic) in the same way that Fighting affects your health: every
time you increase the Spellcasting skill you gain some magic points, and you
gain a spell level every time you reach a skill level divisible by 0.5.
Spellcasting also helps with the power and success rate of your spells, but to
a lesser extent than the more specialised magical skills.

There are also individual skills for each different type of magic; the higher
the skill, the more powerful the spell. Multidisciplinary spells use an average
of the two or three skills.

Miscellaneous skills
========================================

Armour
  Having a high Armour skill means that you are skilled at wearing armour of all
  kinds, multiplying the protection provided not just by body armour but also
  by cloaks, gloves, etc. It also very slightly mitigates the penalties to
  spellcasting and missile weapon speed from wearing heavy armour.

Dodging
  A high Dodging skill helps you to evade melee and ranged attacks more
  effectively. This is more easily done in light armour, but can still be useful
  in heavier armour.

Stealth
  Helps you avoid being noticed, and makes monsters more likely to lose track of
  you when you leave their line of sight. Wearing heavy armour penalises stealth
  attempts. Large creatures (like Trolls) are bad at stealth, except for Nagas,
  which are unusually stealthy.

  Stealth also helps you make a very powerful first strike against a
  sleeping/resting monster who hasn't noticed you yet. This is most effective
  with a dagger, slightly less effective with other short blades and Felid claws,
  and less useful (although still by no means negligible) with any other weapon.

  Stealth also improves some melee attacks against confused, distracted, or
  otherwise incapacitated monsters, though this is much less effective than when
  the monster is asleep or paralysed.

  Note that in addition to the bonus from weapon type, there is an additional
  stabbing bonus based on the average of your stealth skill and your skill with
  your wielded weapon.

Shields
  Affects the amount of protection you gain by using a shield, and the degree to
  which it hinders your evasion, attack speed and spellcasting success.
  Mastering the Shields skill removes all penalties from using a shield.

Invocations
  Affects your ability to call on your god for aid. Those skilled at Invocations
  have reduced failure rates and produce more powerful effects. Some gods (such
  as Trog) do not require followers to learn this skill, or use a different
  skill for their abilities instead (such as Necromancy under Kikubaaqudgha).

  Invocations can increase your maximum magical reserves, although it has a
  smaller effect than Spellcasting in this regard. The bonuses are not cumulative:
  the highest contribution from Spellcasting or Invocations is used.

Evocations
  This skill lets you use wands much more effectively, in terms of both damage
  and precision. Similarly, various other items that have evocable powers work
  better for characters trained in this skill.
