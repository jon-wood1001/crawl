J. Religion
****************************************

There are a number of gods, demons and other assorted powers who will accept
your character's worship, and sometimes give out favours in exchange. You can
use the '^' command to check the requirements of whoever it is that you worship,
and if you find religion to be an inconvenience you can always renounce your
faith (use the 'a' command - but most gods resent being scorned). Further
details can be seen with '!' while in the '^' screen.

To use any powers which your god deems you fit for, access the abilities menu
via the 'a' command; god-given abilities are listed as invocations. Many god
abilities can be 'Q'uivered in order to trigger via the 'f'ire or autofire
interface.

Depending on background, some characters start out religious; others have to
pray at an altar to dedicate themselves to a life of servitude. There are altars
scattered all over the dungeon, and there are rumours of a special temple
somewhere near the surface.

At an altar, you can enter a god's service by pressing < or >. You'll first be
given a description of the god, and then be asked if you really want to join.
To see a list of the standard gods and which of their altars you've seen in your
current game, press 'Ctrl-O'. You can also learn about all gods by pressing
'?/G'.

Note that some gods are picky about who can enter their service; for example,
good gods will not accept demonic or undead devotees.

If you would like to start the game with a religion, choose your background
from Berserker, Chaos Knight, or Cinder Acolyte.
