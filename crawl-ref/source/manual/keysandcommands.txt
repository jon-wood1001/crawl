****************************************
4. List of keys and commands
****************************************

Main screen
========================================

Crawl has many commands to be issued by single key strokes. This can become
confusing, since there are also several modes; here is the full list. Some
commands are particularly useful in combination with certain interface options;
such options are mentioned in the list. For a description of them, please look
into options_guide.txt. For a more terse list of all commands, use '??' in-game.
Most modes (targeting, level map, interlevel travel) also have help menus via
'?' on their own.

Movement
----------------------------------------

direction
  This moves one square. The direction is either one of the numpad cursor keys
  (try both Numlock on and off) or one of the Rogue vi keys (hjklyubn).

Shift-direction or / direction
  This moves straight until something interesting is found (like a monster). If
  the first square is a trap, movement starts nonetheless.

o
  Auto-explore. Setting the option explore_greedy to true makes auto-explore run
  to interesting items (those that get picked up automatically) or piles
  (checking the contents). Autoexploration will open doors on its own unless
  you set travel_open_doors to avoid or approach.

G or Ctrl-G
  Interlevel travel (to arbitrary dungeon levels or waypoints). Remembers old
  destinations if interrupted. This command has its own set of shortcuts; use ?
  for help on them.

Ctrl-W
  Set waypoint (a digit between 0 and 9). Go to a waypoint by pressing Ctrl-G
  or uppercase G, then the waypoint's digit.

Attacking and firing
----------------------------------------

Several of these commands enter targeting mode; see `Targeting`_ for more
information about this mode.

direction
  If a monster is in the target square, attack that monster.

Tab
  Autofight: Attack the nearest monster with your current weapon. If the
  nearest monster is not in range, by default, this will move towards it.

v
  Targeted attacks with your primary weapon, including attacking non-adjacent
  monsters with a polearm, or firing a wielded launcher (regardless of the
  state of the main quiver).

Q
  Quiver an item, spell, or ability from a menu.

( and )
  Cycle quiver to next/previous suitable action (item, spell, ability).

f
  Fire currently quivered action, showing a targeter. If some monster is in
  sight and the action takes a target, either the last target or the nearest
  monster will be automatically highlighted. If the action does not take a
  target, the display will typically show an area of effect. Pressing f again
  triggers the action.

Shift-tab, p
  Autofire: Fire a quivered action, if needed selecting a target automatically;
  typically fires at the nearest monster.

F
  Directly choose ammo to throw or fire. In contrast to 'f' this does not
  interact with the quiver.

V
  Evoke an item directly from the inventory. This includes using wands.

Spells and abilities
----------------------------------------

Spells and abilities may also be quivered; see `Attacking and firing`_. Many
spells and abilities enter targeting mode on activation; see `Targeting`_ for
more information about this mode.

a
  Show the ability menu, allowing you to activate an ability or read its
  description.

z
  Cast a spell. Should the spell demand monsters as targets but there are none
  within range, casting will be stopped. In this case, neither turns nor magic
  are used. If you want to cast the spell nonetheless, use Z.

Z
  Cast a spell regardless of available targets.

Resting
----------------------------------------

s, Del, . or Numpad 5
  Rests for one turn. This is most often used tactically for waiting a few
  turns. Serious resting should be done with the 5 command, for the sake of
  your keyboard and sanity.

5 or Shift-Numpad 5
  Long resting, until both health and magic points are full.

Resting is generally indistinguishable from any other action; healing, magic
point restoration, etc, proceed at the same rate, whether you're resting or not.
A few specific spells can be 'channeled' via the rest key for ongoing effects,
as mentioned in their descriptions.

Dungeon interaction
----------------------------------------

O
  Open door. This is also done automatically by walking into the door.

C
  Close door.

Ctrl-direction or * direction
  Opens/closes a door in the specified direction (if there is one), or
  else attacks without moving (even if no monster is seen).

<
  Use staircase to go higher, or use a shop, altar, or portal.

>
  Use staircase to go deeper, or use a shop, altar, or portal.

;
  Examine occupied tile and auto-pickup eligible items. Can also be used to pick
  up only part of a stack with no other item on the same square.
  When a monster is present the first press of ; will only examine the tile
  and a second press of ; will pick up all auto-pickup eligible items.

x
  Examine surroundings, see below. Has '?' help.

X
  Examine level map, see below. Has '?' help.

Ctrl-X
  Lists all monsters, items and features in sight. You may read their
  descriptions and travel to an item or feature.

Ctrl-O
  Show dungeon overview (branches, shops, etc.).

!
  Annotate a level. You can annotate any level of a branch of which you have
  found the entrance. You can enter any text. This annotation is then listed in
  the dungeon overview (Ctrl-O) and also shown whenever you enter that level
  again. Should your annotation contain an exclamation mark (!), you will be
  prompted before entering the level. An empty string clears annotations.

Other game-playing commands
----------------------------------------

t
  Tell commands to allies, or shout (with tt).

  Find. This searches in stashes and shops, you can use regular expressions and
  also terms like 'long blades', 'shop', 'altar', 'artefact'. If you are looking
  for altars to a special god, a search for 'Trog' , etc. works. A string like
  'D:13' will list all known items on that level. 'D:1}' will search for items
  on level 1 only, as opposed to 'D:1', which will also list items on D:10
  through D:15. Once the list of all found places is displayed, you can cause
  auto-travel to go there (press the associated letter) or you can examine the
  items (press ? followed by the letter).
