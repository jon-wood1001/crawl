C. Attributes and stats
****************************************

The stat area to the right of the playing map shows a lot of information. It
starts with the character's name and title (determined by the character's
highest skill), followed by a line listing the species. If the character
worships a god, the name of the deity is also listed in the second line,
together with an indicator of piety. Below these two lines follow a lot of
numbers. These describe different aspects of the character.

Health
  A measure of life force. Synonymous with hit points and sometimes abbreviated
  as HP. You die if your health drops to zero or less (although you can die in
  other ways, too). The main screen shows both your current and maximum health.
  Usually, you regain health slowly over time. Pressing '5' or Shift-Num-5 lets
  you wait for a longer period.

Magic
  A measure of magic or other intrinsic power. This is used primarily for
  spellcasting, but is sometimes also used for the evoking and invoking of many
  other special abilities. They are displayed in the same way as health;
  nothing bad happens if these drop to zero, except, of course, that you can't
  cast any spells. Resting also restores your reserves of magic.

Next come your defences. For all of them, more is better.

Armour Class
  Abbreviated to "AC". Your AC reduces the amount of damage you suffer from
  most attacks (with a few rare exceptions), and provides some guaranteed
  minimum protection against damage from melee attacks.

Evasion
  Abbreviated to "EV". This helps you avoid being hit by unpleasant things (but
  will not reduce the amount of damage you suffer if you do get hit).

Shield
  Abbreviated to "SH". This number is a measure of how good your shield (if any)
  is at blocking attacks.

Your character's primary attributes are Strength, Intelligence and Dexterity:

Strength
  Abbreviated to "Str". Increases your damage with melee weapons (except for long
  and short blades), with unarmed combat, and with throwing weapons. Reduces
  penalties from wearing shields or heavy armour.

Intelligence
  Abbreviated to "Int". Affects your odds of successfully casting spells and how
  powerful those spells are.

Dexterity
  Abbreviated to "Dex". Increases your accuracy with melee and ranged weapons,
  and your damage with ranged weapons and long and short blades. Significantly
  affects your ability to dodge attacks aimed at you, your effectiveness with
  shields, your stealth, and your effectiveness when stabbing unaware enemies.

These primary attributes grow permanently from gaining levels, and may
increase or decrease temporarily from mutations or while using certain
artefacts or abilities. Upon gaining levels 3, 9, 15, etc., you may choose an
attribute to raise by two points. Most species gain additional attributes at
some levels, with the frequency and the attribute to be increased determined by
species.

If any attribute drops to zero for some reason, you will experience very
unpleasant side-effects, being slowed and suffering some stat-specific
negative effects. These effects will persist for a short while even after the
attribute is restored.

Finally some additional information about your character and your progress
through the dungeon is displayed.

Experience Level
  Abbreviated to "XL". Starting characters have experience level 1; the highest
  possible level is 27. Gaining a level nets additional health and magic points,
  and will grant spell slots and sometimes primary attributes.

Place
  This shows the branch you are currently in, as well as the level within the
  branch. The starting branch is called Dungeon, so that the place information
  will read "Dungeon:1" for a new character.

Noise
  This is a coloured bar indicating the loudness of noise that you heard on your
  last turn. The colour provides a rough guide to how far away the noise it
  indicates might be audible. If the bar is gray, the sound is less likely to
  be audible outside of your line of sight (at least in an open area); if it is
  yellow, the sound is likely to be audible outside of your line of sight; and
  if it is red, the sound will be audible at a substantial distance. If the bar
  turns magenta, you have made one of the loudest noises in the dungeon. N.b.:
  terrain can reduce or block the spread of noise.

Time
  This indicates the amount of time that has passed since entering the dungeon,
  and also displays in brackets the amount of time that your previous action took.
  Most actions take 1.0 units of time, but certain actions are particularly slow
  or quick (such as changing armour and swapping weapons respectively), and other
  actions can vary in time taken depending on your status (such as attacking with
  different weapons and at different skill levels).

There are some additional stats that aren't as important on a turn to turn basis
and thus aren't listed in the main stats area. They can easily be checked with
the '@' or '%' commands, though.

Willpower
  Affects your ability to resist the effects of enchantments and similar
  magic directed at you. Has no effect on direct damage dealt by magic,
  just on more subtle effects. Although your willpower increases with your
  level to an extent determined by your character's species, the creatures
  you will meet deeper in the dungeon are better at casting spells, and are
  more likely to be able to affect you. You can get a rough idea of your
  current Will by pressing '%'.

Size
  Different species have different sizes: Spriggans and Felids are very small;
  Kobolds are small; Ogres and Trolls are large; Nagas and Armataurs are large
  with a medium torso; all other species are medium-sized. Many talismans will
  change your size. Size affects your evasion: the smaller your character, the
  more evasive it is. On the other hand, characters of larger than medium size
  do not suffer the usual attack penalties when standing in shallow water.
  Characters of smaller than medium size will have problems with some larger
  weapons. Very small characters and large characters are not able to use most
  types of armour. Players and monsters can only constrict foes of the same size
  or smaller. In the dungeon you can also meet tiny and giant foes.

Stealth
  High stealth allows your character to move through the dungeon undetected.
  It is affected by your species, dexterity, Stealth skill, and the encumbrance
  of your body armour. Your current Stealth level can also been seen by pressing
  '@' or '%'.

There are many ailments or enchantments that can temporarily befall you. These
are noted in the stats area below the experience line. Many of them are
self-explanatory, like Pois or Slow. Many others, however, can be subtle, and
their effects can be examined by pressing '?/T' and searching for the name of
status effect.

Monsters within your field of vision are listed on a special panel, the monster
list. Single monsters also get indicators of their health status in the form of
a coloured box, and also on effects they enjoy or suffer from. If there are
many monsters in view, the extended monster list can be displayed with
'Ctrl-X'. Within target mode you can directly target single monsters by use of
the monster list by using 'Ctrl-X'.

Sometimes characters will be able to use special abilities, e.g. the Naga's
ability to spit poison or the magical power to turn invisible granted by a
scarf of invisibility. These are accessed through the 'a' command.
