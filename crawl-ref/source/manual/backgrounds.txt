2. List of character backgrounds
****************************************

In your quest, you play as one of a large number of different types of
characters. Although each has its own strengths and weaknesses, some are
definitely easier than others, at least to begin with. The best backgrounds for
a beginner are probably Gladiators and Berserkers; if you really want to play a
magician, try a Conjurer or a Hedge Wizard. However, not all species are equally
well suited for all backgrounds. After you have selected a species, the background
selection menu will show backgrounds generally considered to be more accessible
for a species in a brighter colour.

Each background starts out with a different set of skills and items, but from
there you can shape them as you will. Note that due to peculiarities of size or
body shape, some species-background combinations start with a different
inventory than described here.

Warrior backgrounds
===================

Warriors are experienced at using physical weapons and defending themselves.

Fighters
  Fighters usually start with a good weapon of their choice, a suit of medium
  armour, a shield, and a potion of might.

Gladiators
  The Gladiator has been trained to fight in the ring. They start with a good
  weapon of their choice, light armour, headgear and some throwing weapons and
  nets.

Monks
  Monks have a head start with the divine. They start with only a simple weapon
  of their choice, a potion of divine ambrosia, a robe, and an orb of light to
  guide them. However, when they worship a god for the first time, their
  spiritual training gives them a piety boost.

Hunters
  The Hunter is a type of fighter who specialises in missile weapons. A Hunter
  starts with a shortbow, a scroll of butterflies, and a set of leathers.

Brigands
  A Brigand is a shady character who is especially good at killing, using
  daggers or darts. They start with a dagger, a robe and cloak, poisoned darts,
  and a few deadly and rare curare darts.

Zealot backgrounds
==================

Zealots start the game already worshipping a god.

Berserkers
  Berserkers are hardy warriors who worship Trog the Wrathful, from whom they
  get the power to go berserk (as well as a number of other powers, should they
  prove worthy), but who forbids the use of spell magic. They enter the Dungeon
  with a weapon of their choice, and dressed in animal skins.

Chaos Knights
  The Chaos Knight is a plaything of Xom, subject to the god's constantly
  changing moods. Xom is a very unpredictable (and possibly psychotic) entity
  who rewards or punishes according to whim. They begin with a lightly enchanted
  leather armour, a simple weapon of their choice, and a scroll of butterflies.

Cinder Acolytes
  Cinder Acolytes serve Ignis, the Dying Flame, who grants them incredible
  power over fire... but there is only so much fire left to draw on, and once
  it burns out, acolytes may need to abandon Ignis. They start with a robe,
  a choice of flaming weapons, and the spell Scorch.

Adventurer backgrounds
======================

Adventurers have varied and idiosyncratic skills that they have picked up in
their travels.

Artificers
  Artificers have built, bought or burgled an assortment of magic wands to
  help them through the early Dungeon. Wands have a limited number of uses,
  though, so they'll want to upgrade from their club ASAP.

Shapeshifters
  Shapeshifters use talismans to shift their body into different forms,
  granting them uncanny power but making them unable to use some items.
  They enter the dungeon with two talismans and a potion of lignification.

Wanderers
  Wanderers are "jacks-of-all-trades, masters of none". They start the game
  with a random assortment of skills, items, and maybe spells.

Delvers
  Delvers have, through some mishap, found themselves several floors below the
  surface of the Dungeon. They're equipped with a wide variety of magical escape
  tools, and are well advised to use them to travel to earlier dungeon floors as
  quickly as possible.

Warrior-mage backgrounds
========================

Warrior mages begin the game with a mix of physical combat and magic skills,
though usually excel at neither. They start with a library of spells and
(usually) some way of defending themselves.

Warpers
  Warpers specialise in translocation magic, and are experts in travelling long
  distances and positioning themselves precisely and use this to their advantage
  in melee or missile combat. They start with a scroll of blinking, a selection
  of translocation spells, some dispersal darts, a simple weapon of their choice,
  and leather armour.

Hexslinger
  Hexslingers use debilitating spells to assist their ranged attacks. They
  begin the game with a sling, some spells to support its use, a scroll of
  poison to keep foes at a distance, and a robe.

Enchanters
  The Enchanter specialises in the subtle art of hexes. Instead of directly
  damaging foes, hexes disable and debilitate them, allowing the Enchanter to
  finish the helpless creatures in combat. The Enchanter begins with a lightly
  enchanted dagger, a robe, potions of invisibility, and a selection of hexes.

Reaver
  Reavers have an assortment of powerful, but highly situational, conjurations
  to draw upon when their skill in melee is insufficient. They start with a
  simple weapon of their choice and leather armour.

Mage backgrounds
================

A mage is not an available character background by itself, but a type of
background, encompassing Hedge Wizards, Conjurers, Summoners, Necromancers,
various Elementalists and Venom Mages. Mages are the best at using magic.
Among other things, they start with a robe, a potion of magic, and spells
which should see them through the first several levels of the Dungeon.

Hedge Wizards
  A Hedge Wizard is a magician who does not specialise in any area of magic.
  Hedge Wizards start with a variety of magical skills and with Magic Dart
  memorised, from a large library of varied low-level spells. They also get a
  wizard hat.

Conjurers
  The Conjurer specialises in the violent and destructive magic of conjuration
  spells. Like Wizards, the Conjurer starts with the Magic Dart spell, in their
  case from a library of destructive conjurations.

Summoners
  The Summoner specialises in calling creatures from this and other worlds to
  give assistance. Although they can at first summon only very weak creatures,
  the more advanced summoning spells allow summoners to call on such powers as
  hydras and dragons.

Necromancers
  The Necromancer is a magician who specialises in the less pleasant side of
  magic. Necromantic spells are a varied bunch, but many involve some degree of
  risk or harm to the caster.

Elementalists
  Elementalists are magicians who specialise in one of the four types of
  elemental magic: air, fire, earth or ice.

  Fire Magic
    tends towards indiscriminate, wide-range destructive conjurations and
    starting fires.

  Ice Magic
    offers diffuse, subtle effects, both defensive and offensive.

  Air Magic
    provides powerful but difficult to direct spells.

  Earth Magic
    offers direct effects, some destructive and some debilitating.

Venom Mages
  Venom Mages specialise in poison magic, which is extremely useful in the
  shallower levels of the Dungeon where few creatures are immune to it.
