D. Exploring the dungeon
****************************************

Movement
========================================

You can make your character walk around with the numeric keypad (try both
Numlock on and off) or the "Rogue" keys (hjklyubn). If this is too slow, you can
make your character walk repeatedly by pressing Shift and a direction;
alternatively, press '/' followed by a direction. You will walk in that
direction until any of a number of things happen: a hostile monster is visible
on the screen, a message is sent to the message window for any reason, you press
a key, or you are about to step on anything other than normal floor and it is
not your first move of the long walk. Note that this is functionally equivalent
to just pressing the direction key several times.

Another convenient method for moving long distances is described in the section
on Automated Travel and Exploration below.

Combat
========================================

The dungeon is a hostile place, and you will likely need to defend yourself. The
basic case of combat involves melee attacks: if you are adjacent to a monster,
moving towards that monster will cause you to attack it with a wielded melee
weapon, or your fists. There are also a wide variety of ways to attack monsters
that are further away, including polearms (which can reach a tile away), various
bows, launchers, and throwable items, magical items that can be evoked such as
wands, spells, and abilities. These are described throughout the rest of this
document. These are triggered in a variety of ways, but one commonality is that
all of these can be quivered: the quiver provides quick access to an action that
can be fired.

Both melee and ranged combat provide shortcuts that autotarget the nearest
enemy, if there is one available. Your wielded weapon can be triggered by Tab
("Autofight"), moving towards or attacking the nearest enemy depending on
whether there is one in range for the weapon. Your quivered action can be
triggered by Shift-Tab or 'p' ("Autofire"); if the action takes a target the
nearest enemy will be selected, otherwise the action will be triggered. See
`Attacking and firing`_ for the full key list related to attacking, quivers, and
firing.

Resting
========================================

If you press '5', you will rest until your health or magic return to full. You
can rest for just one turn by pressing '.' or 's'.

Resting stops if a monster appears or if you are otherwise interrupted.

Examining your surroundings
========================================

The section of the viewing window which is coloured (with the "@" representing
you at the centre) is what you can see around you. The dark grey around it is
the parts of the level which you have visited, but cannot currently see. The 'x'
command lets you move the cursor around to get a description of the various
dungeon features, and typing 'v' when the cursor is over a monster or feature
brings up a short description of that monster, as well as a short list of its
various strengths, weaknesses, immunities, and any spells or abilities it has.
This is generally useful with monsters you've never encountered before. You can
also select monsters and features from a list by pressing 'Ctrl-X'. You can get
a map of the whole level (which shows where you've already been) by typing 'X'.

You can see the full set of commands available while looking around by pressing
'?', both in the 'x' and 'X' modes.

Staircases and Portals
========================================

You can make your way between levels by using staircases, which appear as ">"
(down) and "<" (up), by pressing the '>' or '<' keys. It is important to know
that most monsters adjacent to you will follow when you change levels; this
holds both for hostile and allied monsters. Notable exceptions are zombies
and other mindless undead, who are too stupid to properly operate stairs.

When taking stairs with an unknown destination, you are guaranteed a chance to
move before any adjacent monsters. When taking stairs that you've already seen
the other side of, monsters will be alert and get a chance to move before you.

If you ascend an up staircase on level one, you will leave the dungeon forever;
if you are carrying the magical Orb of Zot, you win the game by doing this.
Otherwise, the game ends, and you lose.

Besides the dungeon you start in, Crawl's dungeon has many branches. All of them
are themed and host opponents of some special sort. It is not mandatory to visit
any particular branch, but you must explore some of them: progress to the Realms
of Zot (where the Orb is located) is only possible for adventurers who have at
least three magical runes of Zot. The bottoms of several branches contain such
runes.

Occasionally you will find an archway (displayed as "\\" or as an actual arch);
these lead to special places like shops, themed one-off portals, or special
branches such as Hell and Pandemonium. You can enter these by typing '<' or '>'.
A few portals only accept one of '<' and '>'.

Doors and Traps
========================================

Doors can usually be opened by just walking into them (there is an option to
disable this); else this can also be done using the 'O' command. They can be
closed with the 'C' command. Pressing Ctrl plus a direction, or '*' followed by
a direction, will open/close doors, too.

If there is no door in the indicated space, both Ctrl-direction and
'*'-direction will attempt to attack any monster which may be standing there
(this is the only way to attack a friendly creature with melee combat). If there
is apparently nothing there, you will still attack it, just in case there's
something invisible lurking around.

The malevolent forces of Zot will attempt to thwart your progress through the
dungeon, and will occasionally manifest traps to force you into dangerous
situations. Some traps are visible in advance and can be triggered by monsters
to unleash their effects on you.

Shops
========================================

When you visit a shop (by using < or > while standing on one), you are shown
what the shopkeeper has in stock and can choose what to buy. Unfortunately,
the shopkeepers all have an exclusive deal with the Guild of Dungeon Procurers
which prevents them using non-guild labour to obtain stock, so you can't sell
anything in a shop. (But then, what shopkeeper would buy stolen goods from a
disreputable adventurer, anyway?)

To purchase one or more items, select them by pressing the letters of the item
in the shop menu and then press Enter to make the purchase; you can examine
items before buying them by pressing '!' and then the letter of the item.

If you've lost track of the shops in the dungeon, you can get a list of all the
shops you've found in the dungeon overview (use 'Ctrl-O').

You can also use the stash search: Hitting 'Ctrl-F' and searching for "shop"
will list all stores. The stash-search menu allows you travel quickly to a
particular shop; if you just want to know what's in the shop, you can also
examine the shop's inventory from the search menu without having to travel all
the way to the shop.

Some shops are antique stores that sell items of unknown provenance, usually at
a good discount. The dungeon overview screen displays these with yellow glyphs.

If you're short on gold for some particularly interesting commodity, you can
place it onto your shopping list. The game will interrupt you when you have
collected enough gold to finally purchase an item on that list. You can read the
shopping list in the game with '$'.

Automated Travel and Exploration
========================================

Crawl has an extensive automated travel system: pressing 'G' (or also 'Ctrl-G')
lets you choose any dungeon level; the game will then take the shortest path to
reach this destination. You can also use autotravel on the level map ('X'): Move
the cursor to the place where you want to go and hit Enter. There are several
shortcuts when choosing destinations: For example, try '<' and '>' to quickly
reach the staircases.

When your autotravel gets interrupted, Crawl will remember the previous
destination. Hitting 'G' or 'Ctrl-G' again and following with Enter puts the
cursor on that square. See Appendix `4. List of Keys and Commands`_ for all
commands and shortcuts in level-map mode, or press 'G?' or 'X?' within the game.

Another use of autotravel is exploration: 'o' makes your character move to the
nearest unexplored area. Note that this algorithm does not attempt any
optimisation by default. By manual exploration you can save turns, but
auto-explore will usually save real time.

Stashes and Searching
========================================

Since you can only carry 52 items, you will occasionally want to stash things
away (by dropping them with the 'd' command). When you want to search for
something in your stashes, you can do this with the Find command 'Ctrl-F'. The
parser even accepts regular expressions, although you will mostly just need
strings like 'mutation', 'heal wounds', etc. You will be presented with a list
of all places where objects matching the search are (or have been) located; you
can then travel there or examine the pile. The Find command will also search in
shop inventories. Furthermore, you can search skills like 'long blades' (this
will find all weapons training the long blades skill) or general terms like
'shop', 'altar', 'portal', 'artefact', etc. You can get help on finding by
pressing '?' at the prompt.

The Goal
========================================

Your goal is to locate the Orb of Zot, which is held somewhere deep beneath the
world's surface. The Orb is an ancient and incredibly powerful artefact, and the
legends promise great things for anyone brave enough to extract it from the
fearsome Dungeon. Some say it will grant immortality or even godhood to the one
who carries it into the sunlight; many undead creatures seek it in the hope that
it will restore them to life. But then, some people will believe anything. Good
luck!

Zot
========================================

No one knows who or what Zot is: demon, god, wizard, something else entirely?
But adventurers seeking the Orb will, in turn, be hunted by Zot. Even a moment's
contact with Zot is enough to permanently damage one's health.

Zot is very slow moving, and can only sense adventurers once they've spent an
inordinately long time in one area of the dungeon. Even once this happens,
adventurers will have plenty of warning to either descend to new depths in the
area (diffusing Zot's attention once more) or to leave the area entirely.

The Abyss is beyond Zot's comprehension, and adventurers there are safe from
it (albeit subject to many other hazards). The Hells, along with their
Vestibule, are a single area as far as Zot is concerned. Rumours claim there
are ways to escape Zot's pursuit forever, but what magics could be mighty
enough to forestall such an implacable entity?

Seeded play
========================================

Crawl dungeons are determined by a "seed" number used to initialise the game's
random number generator. You may either let the game choose a seed randomly,
or specify a seed; if you choose a seed this puts the game in "Seeded" mode,
which is scored separately. Playing games with the same seed value, as long as
the game version is constant, should (within certain parameters) lead to the
same dungeon. The entire connected dungeon will be determined by the game
seed, including dungeon layout, monster placement, and items. Portal vaults
and chaotic zones such as the Abyss are not guaranteed to be the same, and the
placement of rare unique artefacts may vary depending on certain player
actions.

To set a game seed, use the "Choose game seed" option from the main menu; you
can also use the 'game_seed' rc file option, or the '-seed' command line
option. In offline games you can view your game's seed with '?V' as well as in
a character file; in online games a randomly chosen seed will only be shown to
you after finishing the game.

If you find that the same seed generates distinct parts of a dungeon on the
same or different devices, please report it as a bug. However, keep in mind
that upgrading your save game between multiple versions of crawl will
naturally lead to seed divergence. When playing offline, if you would like to
ensure that your game can be upgraded without divergence, you can set
'pregen_dungeon = full' in your options file. (This will also ensure
completely stable unique artefact placement.) On the other hand, to completely
disable incremental pregeneration, you can set 'pregen_dungeon = false'.

Further Help
========================================

To access Crawl's help menu, press '?'. To get the list of all commands, press
'?' again. A different, more verbose description of the commands also appears in
Appendix `4. List of Keys and Commands`_ of this text. Various other help texts
are available as well, including this manual. You can also read the logbook from
there by pressing ':'. Note that several commands have their own help screens,
among them are targeting ('f'), level map ('X'), travel ('G' or 'Ctrl-G') and
searching ('Ctrl-F'); again, press '?' when asked for input.

If you don't like the standard keyset (either because some keys do not work
properly, or because you want to decrease the amount of typing necessary), you
can use keymaps and macros. See macros_guide.txt in the docs/ directory, or read
it from the in-game help menu.
